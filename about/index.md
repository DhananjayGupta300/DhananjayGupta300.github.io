### About my Professional and Academic Pursuit
A deep-rooted interest of staying abreast with newly evolving trends in technology and how technology has made life very comfortable has dawned upon me that we live in the Age of Technology where every single day sees a spate of new concepts and applications being devised and each passing day making them obsolete. The rapid boom in engineering and technology, particularly computer science which offers a surfeit of exciting job opportunities, has thrusted my decision on embarking a career path in this thriving sector. A fascination with computers coupled with their capability to solve difficult problems in an optimum manner, propelled my interest towards improving my knowledge set and skills in the same direction. Problem solving, mathematical puzzles and devising new algorithms is where my strength lies. Thus, pursuing my Master's in Computer Science was an easy decision. <br><br/>
The subjects that interestes me are Data Structure and Algorithms, Operating System, and Compiler Design and Automata since they involved extensive computational and problem solving skills where my interest lies. In retrospect, endowed with a puzzle solving and intuitive mind, I was exposed to chess at the age of 9. Seeing my natural flair for chess, my father gifted me a personal computer since he wanted me to play chess on the computer to refine my skills. Gradually, I developed a penchant towards playing mind games on computer and soon started coding simple games. Since our curriculum included programming languages from 6th grade, I was exposed to a strong technical foundation since a young age. <br><br/>
I have always stood among the top 3 students at school and was bestowed a **full tuition fee waiver scholarship** for 11th and 12thgrade on account of my exceptional performance in my 10th grade. The Computer Science department at the University of Illinois at Chicago has **awarded** me with an **graduate level assistanship** for my Master's. <br/><br/>
### About Projects and Work Experience 
I developed an Online Shopping Web Application as the culmination of my training in using J2SE, J2EE and related technologies. Through these technologies I implemented a very efficient shopping cart and encryption technique while designing a secure login system. Apart from these I have done volunteer projects on ATM simulation, best CPU schedulling algorithm. Additionally, I have had **attended technical workshops** for Object Oriented Design using RSA, Software Testing and Design using RFT, student development program on ERP and Business Intelligence Reporting. I hold EMC Academic Associate **certifications** in Cloud Infrastructure and service, Information Storage and Management. I **pursuded a research** on improving the efficiencies of priority queues as my academic major project. I hold recognition certificates from WCMAS, a program based on visual arithmetic and computation skills, for my exceptional performance at state level.<br/><br/>
I successfully completed a **summer internship** at VIBS Infosol, Indore, India. wherein, I Worked full stack on Express, Angular, Node and Angular to create an apparel store for the web app and 2 more applications. My job responsibilities spanned through designing the databases for the various applications and implementing the back-end functionalities for them. I also worked on full stack on AngularJS and NodeJS. <br/> <br/>

### About Leadership, Management and Hobbies
I harbor an inclination towards **music** and have been awarded a certificate with **distinction** from **Trinity College London** for my proficiency in **classical guitar**.<br/><br/>
I underwent training at the **International Association of Lions Clubs** wherein I successfully completed my training in Lions District Leadership Workshop-2015. Trained on Change Management, Communication, Conducting Effective Meetings, Mentoring Program,
Creative Thinking, Focused Discussion, Evaluation.<br/><br/>
I have volunteered for Indian Water Works Association and All World Gayatri Pariwar which is a living model of a futuristic society. Volunteered in organizing several human wellbeing programs and rural education drive.<br/><br/> 

### Professional Vission
At this crucial juncture, I am inclined towards the Masterâ€™s program in Computer Science offered at the university of Illinois at Chicago, which is the best platform for any student pursuing a career in this field in terms of the quality of education, research facilities and world-class faculty. In an atmoshphere like which boasts of a confluence of people from every culture, nationality, religion and ideology, I am confident of reflecting strong ethical values, inclusiveness and developing my personality for the better. I am optimistic that my education will equip me with the best set of skills and expertise to scale great heights professionally. After completion of the program, I aspire to work as a software engineer and later use the work experience to contribute towards society.
