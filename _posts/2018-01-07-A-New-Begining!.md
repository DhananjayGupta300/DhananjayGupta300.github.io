The date had finally come! all hardwork and unlimited shopping culminates on 2nd August, 2017. I am leaving home to pursue my Master's in Computer Science at the pretigious University of Illinois at Chicago. It had been a roller coaster ride. Ecstatic moments, heartbreaks and sleepless nights; I have seen all. I have made no opinions. Let's see the things the way they are. 
### Consious organic chaos! to a World of order 

Everything in order seems like a snapshot of life to me and a concious chaos as a kaleidoscope. The heading says it all! This is my first impression. It makes me realize, I had been looking at life thorugh a kaleidoscope (India) and now, here I see life in snapshots (USA). Nevertheless, it just intensifies my longing to know life even more. Ok! for now; enough of spirituality and philosophies. I am getting my ass kicked here! It has been a steep learning curve. Heretofore, I have maintained a healthy GPA, should rather get back to studies now. Would be posting about my learning curve, stay tunned!
